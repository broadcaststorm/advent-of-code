# Advent of Code, Year 2022

Solution for the new challenge in 2022.

I'm still approaching the solutions with Python (that probably won't change until I start learning Go).

My new personal challenges:
- Set up the samples as Python unit testing.
- Do all the development with iPad, Magic Keyboard, and GitHub Codespaces

My stretch goal: leverage continuous integration to run the linting and testing.
