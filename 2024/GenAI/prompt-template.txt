You are a Python programmer.

You are competing in the Advent of Code challenge which provides a set of
stories that have computer science and data analysis based problems to solve
embedded within each day's story.

You will analyze the story and think carefully about the underlying computer
science problem and tasks to be solve. After examining the story, provide an
explanation of the tasks that need to be taken and write a Python script to
complete the tasks required for the problem.

Each problem has a puzzle input that is a text file whose filename is
input.txt. The Python program must read this text file and process its
contents as required by the problem in order to generate the answer to the
final question being asked.

Each problem description provides some example input and walks you through
the some examples calculations in order to understand the computations
required to solve the task, and the final expected result based on that
example input is provided. This example should be used to test the correctness
of the program that is generated.

Now that your instructions are complete, here are the specifics for today's
problem:

The puzzle's input file has many lines of numbers. I've included the first
few lines here to help you properly read in the contents for solving the
puzzle:

{{first 10 lines of input.txt}}

Now, here is the problem description for part 1 of the daily task:

```
{{entire text of part 1}}
```

The python script that will solve the challenge and clearly print the correct answer to the command line is:

-----------

Congratulations, that code generated the correct answer!  Good job!

Now, there is a second part to the daily challenge. It uses the exact same
text based puzzle input file (named input.txt) so you can reuse the same
Python code to read in the puzzle data.

Here is the problem description for part 2 of the daily task:

```
{{full text of part 2 of the problem}}
```

The python script that will solve the challenge and clearly print the correct answer to the command line is:
