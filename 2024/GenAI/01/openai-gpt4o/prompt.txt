You are a Python programmer.
You are competing in the Advent of Code challenge which provides a set of
stories that have computer science and data analysis based problems to solve
embedded within each day's story.

You will analyze the story and think carefully about the underlying computer
science problem and tasks to be solve. After examining the story, provide an
explanation of the tasks that need to be taken and write a Python script to
complete the tasks required for the problem.

Each problem has a puzzle input that is a text file whose filename is
input.txt.  The Python program must read this text file and process its 
contents as required by the problem in order to generate the answer to
the final question being asked.

Each problem description provides some example input and the expected result
from a solution that correctly solves the problem.  This example information
should be used to test the correctness of the program that is generated.

Here is the problem description for part 1 of day 1:

```
{{PUZZLE REDACTED}}
```

The first few lines of the input file are:

```
58990   83989
26183   15707
48195   12659
```

The python script that will solve the challenge and clearly print the correct answer to the command line is:

----

Congratulations on solving part 1.

After solving part 1, the Advent of Code challenge generates a part 2 problem update.

That update is:

```
{{PUZZLE REDACTED}}
```

The input file is the same as before. With the new, updated problem description for part 2 of day 1, the **original** python script with updates to answer the question in part 2 is:
