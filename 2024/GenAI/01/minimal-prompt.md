Assuming there is a text input file named input.txt with an arbitrarily long list of expected input values structure liked the example input above, solve the above challenge in Python 3.12 with the script printing the finall answer to stdout.
```

## Model output

Here's the solution to the problem:

```python
def total_distance(left_list, right_list):
    """Calculate the total distance between two lists of location IDs"""
    
    # Combine both lists and sort them
    combined_list = sorted(left_list + right_list)
    
    # Initialize total distance
    total_dist = 0
    
    # Iterate over the combined list to find the pairs with smallest numbers first
    for i in range(len(combined_list)):
        left_num = combined_list[i]
        
        # Find a corresponding number on the other side of the list (with the same index)
        right_index = len(right_list) + len(left_list) - 1 - i
        
        right_num = combined_list[right_index]
        
        # If they are not equal, add their distance to the total
        if left_num != right_num:
            total_dist += abs(left_num - right_num)
    
    return total_dist


# Read input from file and split it into two lists
with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]
    left_list = []
    right_list = []
    
    # Populate the left and right lists
    for line in lines:
        values = list(map(int, line.split()))
        left_list.extend(values[:len(values)//2])
        right_list.extend(values[len(values)//2:])

# Calculate total distance between the two lists and print it out
ans = total_distance(left_list, right_list)
print("The final answer is", ans)
```

This script opens an input file named `input.txt` in read mode. It then reads each line from the file into a list of lines. For each 
line, it splits it by spaces to create a list of numbers, and divides this list into two halves (the left and right lists). After 
processing all lines, it calls the function `total_distance` with these lists as arguments, which computes the total distance between 
them according to the problem's rules. The result is then printed out.

This solution assumes that the input file `input.txt` exists in the same directory where the script is executed and has the correct 
format (i.e., two numbers per line separated by spaces). 

Please note that you need Python 3.x for this script, as it uses f-strings which were introduced in version 3.6.
