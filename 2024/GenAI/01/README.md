# GenAI Learnings, Questions

Does Ollama have a memory?
- For a clean session with two identical prompts, should I expect the same output?
- There seems to be some serious variation.
- Maybe that's temperature and random number variations?

So, day 01, I wasn't nearly as structured and deliberate with the GenAI activities so just saving it as is.  Day 02 was much more structured!
