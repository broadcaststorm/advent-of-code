"""
Here's an updated Python script that calculates the similarity score based on the new rules:
```python
import sys

def calculate_similarity_score(left_list, right_list):
    similarity_score = 0
    for num in left_list:
        appearances = right_list.count(num)
        if appearances > 0:
            similarity_score += num * appearances
    return similarity_score

with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = [line.strip().split() for line in f.readlines()]

left_list = [int(num) for line in lines for num in line[:1]]
right_list = [int(num) for line in lines for num in line[1:]]

similarity_score = calculate_similarity_score(left_list, right_list)
print("The final answer is:", similarity_score)
```
Here's what changed:

* We defined a new function `calculate_similarity_score` that takes two lists as input and returns the similarity score.
* Inside this function, we iterate over each number in the left list.
* For each number, we count how many times it appears in the right list using the `count()` method. If it appears at least once, we add 
its product with the number of appearances to the similarity score.
* Finally, we return the total similarity score.

This script should produce the correct answer for part 2 of the challenge.
