The answer your script produces using the full input file is 245.
The correct answer is 202.

Can you debug your script and identify and correct the logic error in the program?

After re-examining my previous code, I realize that I made a mistake in the `is_safe` function. The issue lies in the fact 
that the levels are being compared to their preceding level as well as the next level (i.e., both `a <= b` and `a >= b` for 
all pairs of adjacent elements).

To fix this, we need to check if the report's levels are either all increasing or all decreasing separately. Here's the 
corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(report):
    """
    Check if a report is safe.
    
    A report is considered safe if its levels are either all increasing or all decreasing,
    and each level differs by at least 1 and at most 3 from its previous level.
    
    Parameters:
    report (list): A list of numbers representing the levels in a report.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the report is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    increasing = all(a <= b for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))
    decreasing = all(a >= b for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))
    
    # Check levels are either all increasing or all decreasing
    if not (increasing or decreasing):
        return False
    
    # Check each level differs by at most 3 from its previous level
    return all(abs(b - a) <= 3 for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))

def count_safe_reports(input_file):
    """
    Count the number of safe reports.
    
    Parameters:
    input_file (str): The path to the input file containing the reports.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of safe reports.
    """
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        reports = [line.strip().split() for line in f.readlines()]
    return sum(1 for report in reports if is_safe([int(level) for level in report]))

def main():
    input_file = 'input.txt'
    safe_reports_count = count_safe_reports(input_file)
    print(f'The number of safe reports is {safe_reports_count}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

With this correction, the script should produce the correct answer for the given problem.
