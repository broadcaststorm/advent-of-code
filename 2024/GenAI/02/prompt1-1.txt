You are a Python programmer.

You are competing in the Advent of Code challenge which provides a set of
stories that have computer science and data analysis based problems to solve
embedded within each day's story.

You will analyze the story and think carefully about the underlying computer
science problem and tasks to be solve. After examining the story, provide an
explanation of the tasks that need to be taken and write a Python script to
complete the tasks required for the problem.

Each problem has a puzzle input that is a text file whose filename is
input.txt. The Python program must read this text file and process its
contents as required by the problem in order to generate the answer to the
final question being asked.

Each problem description provides some example input and walks you through
the some examples calculations in order to understand the computations
required to solve the task, and the final expected result based on that
example input is provided. This example should be used to test the correctness
of the program that is generated.

Now that your instructions are complete, here are the specifics for today's
problem:

The puzzle's input file has many lines of numbers. I've included the first
few lines here to help you properly read in the contents for solving the
puzzle:

80 82 81 82 83 85 88
48 51 54 55 58 57 55
41 44 47 50 47 47
66 68 71 70 73 77
29 32 29 30 35

Now, here is the problem description for part 1 of the daily task:

```
{{PUZZLE REDACTED}}
```

The python script that will solve the challenge and clearly print the correct answer to the command line is:

### Answer

Here's a Python script to solve the problem:

```python
def is_safe(report):
    """
    Check if a report is safe.
    
    A report is considered safe if all levels are either increasing or decreasing,
    and each level differs by at least 1 and at most 3 from its previous level.
    
    Parameters:
    report (list): A list of numbers representing the levels in a report.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the report is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    increasing = all(a <= b for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))
    decreasing = all(a >= b for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))
    return (increasing or decreasing) and all(abs(b - a) <= 3 for a, b in zip(report[:-1], report[1:]))

def count_safe_reports(input_file):
    """
    Count the number of safe reports.
    
    Parameters:
    input_file (str): The path to the input file containing the reports.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of safe reports.
    """
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        reports = [line.strip().split() for line in f.readlines()]
    return sum(1 for report in reports if is_safe([int(level) for level in report]))

def main():
    input_file = 'input.txt'
    safe_reports_count = count_safe_reports(input_file)
    print(f'The number of safe reports is {safe_reports_count}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script defines two functions: `is_safe` checks if a single report is safe, and `count_safe_reports` counts the total 
number of safe reports in the input file. The `main` function reads the input file, counts the safe reports, and prints the 
result to the console.

To run this script, simply save it as a Python file (e.g., `solve.py`) and execute it with `python solve.py`. Make sure that 
your input file is named `input.txt` in the same directory. The script will print the number of safe reports to the command 
line.
