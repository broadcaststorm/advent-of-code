Solutions to https://adventofcode.com challenges 

## Goal of this repository

I'm not hear to dazzle you with my leet hacker skillz... if anything, you could get free entertainment from the "quality" you observe.  This code is made public to help you learn to code as well.  If you get stuck, feel free to take a peek.  

If you are simply trying to learn, by all means, review what I've done and see if you understand it.  If something doesn't make sense, feel free to ask questions (via Issues on GitHub or Tweet me @broadcastsorm).  If you'd like to see something described in better detail, let me know and I'll do what I can.

Enjoy!
